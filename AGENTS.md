# AGENTS.md — house rules for this repo

Canonical agent guide for the personal CLI toolchain. `CLAUDE.md` is a symlink
to this file, so Claude Code and any AGENTS.md-aware tool read the same source.
Read this before editing; it answers the questions agents otherwise re-derive
from the code every session.

Small bash/zsh/node tools that share one look and feel.

## Repo conventions

- **Solo-authored. Work on `main`.** No `Co-Authored-By` / "Claude" trailers in
  commits, no AI attribution in messages. Commit/push only when asked.
- After meaningful vault-affecting work, the operator runs `hq sync`.

## Layout

- `bin/` — exactly one executable per tool, nothing else. `tools install`,
  the completions, `tools doctor`, and CI all discover tools by globbing
  `bin/*`.
- `lib/` — shared helpers flat (`common.sh`, `init.sh`, `key.sh`,
  `drift.sh`); tool-specific support files under `lib/<tool>/` (e.g.
  `lib/hq/`, `lib/site/`, `lib/doc-to-pdf/`). `drift.sh` is the shared core
  for the drift-guard tools (`ts-acl`, `cf-dns`, `adguard`, `nginx`): they
  provide `get_token`/`fetch_live`/`normalize` + config and call `drift_main`.
  On a successful `pull`, `drift.sh` stamps the vault doc's `last_reviewed`
  through the MCP (see below) — a pull is a review.
- `config/` — per-tool defaults derived from layout env vars. Files ending
  `.example` are templates; their gitignored copies are user-specific.
- `tests/` — bats suite. Hermetic: throwaway keys, tmpdirs, no Keychain.
- `bench/` — every measured claim in the README has a script here that
  asserts it; they run in CI.

## Calling severino-vault-mcp from this repo

We own the MCP (`~/Documents/Code/Assets/severino-vault-mcp/`). Shell tools call
it as a plain CLI — **don't** hand-edit vault frontmatter or shell out to `yq`;
the MCP is the schema-validated, atomic writer.

In `bin/site`, every call goes through the **`svmc()`** wrapper, which sets
`SVMC_VAULT_PATH="$NOTES_HOME"` and names the binary in one place:

```bash
svmc <subcommand> [args] [--pretty]     # in bin/site
SVMC_VAULT_PATH="$NOTES_HOME" severino-vault-mcp <subcommand> ...   # elsewhere
```

Add new call sites through `svmc`, never inline — an inline call that forgets
`SVMC_VAULT_PATH` silently falls back to the MCP's own configured default vault.

The console script is on PATH (`uv tool install`). Existing subcommands:
`touch-reviewed <relative-path>` (set `last_reviewed` to today — used by
`drift.sh`; **fast path: skips the vault-cache rebuild the other writers pay
for**), `prepare-writeup-publish`, `list-writeups`, `technology-catalog`,
`validate-all-writeups`, `reorder-featured`, `update-writeup`, `hq-manifest`,
`schema`, `doctor`. Each wraps the same-named tool in `server.py`, prints JSON,
exits 0/1 on `ok`. `bin/site` is the reference caller; `lib/drift.sh:drift_touch_reviewed`
is the minimal one (overridable via `$DRIFT_REVIEW_BIN` so bats can stub it).

**Shared frontmatter schema:** the MCP's `schema.py` is the one canonical enum
contract; `severino-vault-mcp schema --json` emits it. `hq schema` regenerates
HQ's committed `docs_index/schema.json` from it, and `hq schema --check` fails on
drift (CI / pre-deploy, including the vault's Frontmatter Schema doc). Don't
hand-maintain enum lists anywhere downstream.

**No hand-rolled logic in `bin/hq`:** `hq doctor` reports the vault↔HQ gap via
`severino-vault-mcp hq-manifest --report` (not a re-walk), and `hq validate`
calls HQ's `manage.py audit_registry` (not an inline ORM script over SSH). Keep
the contract/logic in the MCP or a `manage.py` command; `bin/hq` just formats.

**Cross-repo JSON contract** (keep both sides in sync):
- One JSON object per call; exit 0 on success, 1 on failure.
- Failures use a single `{"ok": false, "error": "<message>"}` envelope
  (singular `error`). `lib/site/manage-tui.mjs` reads `json.error`; preserve
  that shape when adding or changing MCP tools.

**To expose another MCP tool to the shell:** add a subparser + handler in the
MCP's `src/severino_vault_mcp/__main__.py` (mirror an existing block), then
`site reinstall-mcp`. `site` runs the *installed* console script, so a stale
`uv tool` install is real drift — `site doctor`'s `--fingerprint` check catches
it (installed fingerprint vs source).

## Conventions (enforced by review, checked by CI)

- New bash tools: scaffold with `tools new <name>` — it emits the canonical
  skeleton. Every tool sources `lib/init.sh`, uses `msg`/`die`/`header`/
  `footer` for output, and exits 0 (success/skips), 1 (failure), 2 (usage).
- Every tool answers `-h`/`--help`.
- `dns-test` is the lone zsh exception to the bash rule.
- Node code is ESM (`.mjs`), deps pinned in the root `package.json`,
  resolved by upward `node_modules` lookup. **Node is the JSON tool in `bin/site`**
  (URL-encoding, payloads, MCP-output parsing); `jq` belongs to the drift
  guards in `lib/drift.sh`. Keep each file on one parser.
- Adding a tool: drop it in `bin/`, add it to the `#compdef` line in
  `completions/_tools-suite` (doctor flags drift), document it in README.

## Site visual comparison

When reviewing a local site change against production, use the viewer:

```sh
site compare /route/to/check/ --no-open
```

Then open the printed localhost URL with the available browser automation tool.
Don't build an ad hoc iframe page or open two unrelated tabs. The viewer gives
labeled DEV/LIVE panes, a synchronized divider, linked scrolling, route nav,
reload, and side swapping. The Astro dev server must be running (`site dev`)
unless the requested dev URL is already up.

## Verify (do this before claiming a change works)

`tools check` runs everything CI runs: shebang-driven `bash -n`/`zsh -n`/
`node --check`, shellcheck, the bats suite, and the bench assertions.
`--no-bench` skips the slow step. `tools status --json` / `tools doctor --json`
give machine-readable state.

For a fast inner loop while editing one area:
- `bats tests/<file>.bats` — hermetic, ~seconds. Run it after editing `bin/site`
  or `lib/*.sh`; it catches integration regressions (e.g. a broken MCP call)
  that reading the diff will not.
- `shellcheck -x bin/<tool> lib/*.sh` — matches CI lint.

## Cautions (time-savers learned the hard way)

- **`replace_all` on a short substring is dangerous**: it will also rewrite that
  text *inside a helper you just added* (a literal MCP invocation collapsed into
  the new `svmc()` body, creating `svmc() { svmc …; }` infinite recursion). The
  bats suite caught it. Prefer targeted edits, or re-grep + run bats after a
  bulk replace.
- `encrypt`/`decrypt`/`open-age`/`lib/key.sh` handle key material — keep temp
  files mode 600, keep the exit traps, and use plain `if` (not `[[ ]] &&`) as
  the last statement in trap handlers under `set -e`.
- `config/backup.sh` and `config/site.sh` are user-local; never commit or lint
  them in CI (non-reproducible).
- Don't vendor external projects into `lib/` — tools that outgrow a script live
  in their own repo and are launched by path.
- The tools repo often carries a large in-flight changeset. Don't bundle an
  unrelated edit into the operator's pending work — make it its own commit, or
  leave it staged and say so.
